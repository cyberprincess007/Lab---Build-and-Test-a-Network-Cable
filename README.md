# Lab---Build-and-Test-a-Network-Cable
In this lab, I built my own Ethernet cable using the T568B wiring standard. I measured and cut the cable, arranged the wires in the correct order, crimped on RJâ€‘45 connectors, and tested it with a cable tester. I then connected it to devices to confirm it worked by checking the link lights and running network tests like ping.
